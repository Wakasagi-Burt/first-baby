Our motivation to build this project was to make a website where user can find their favourite movie and watch them and also leave review.
We made this project to resolve problem for the audience which loves movies and they have to keep going to different websites our website would be one stop shop who loves watching  movies and leaves reviews as well.
The biggest problem our website will solve is that user doesn't have to keep changing tabs and keep looking for for the other links.
In this project there were some important skills we were aable to learn such as pair programming, team colabration, learning while teaching, there were different languages we used HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. we also used libraries such as bootstrap and jquery.
There are few features which are very unique in our website which will draw user's attention, such as carousel,  and watchlist feature
